## The structure of open.engineering

 - Given where this project operates I would like to try 3 things with the first iteration of this project:
 - that it not be profit driven, but instead uses earnings to grow and help its community
 - that it does all of its accounting openly and transparently
 - that it is democratically controlled by its members.

These are some very ideological points that are most likely not all implementable at the first iteration. The goal is to work towards them.
